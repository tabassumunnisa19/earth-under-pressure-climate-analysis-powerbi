# 🌍 Earth Under Pressure — Climate Systems & Human Impact Analysis (Power BI)

## 📖 Overview

This project is a **research-based, data-driven analysis** that examines how rising global temperatures are placing increasing pressure on the Earth’s climate system.  
Using multiple historical and environmental datasets, the analysis explores the **interconnected relationship between temperature rise, natural climate variability, human activities, and climate-related disasters**.

The goal of this project is not to analyze a single factor in isolation, but to **connect climate signals across systems** — global, regional, and local — and present them through an integrated Power BI dashboard.

## 🔬 Research Motivation

Climate change is often discussed through isolated indicators such as temperature rise or carbon emissions.  
This project was designed to **bring multiple climate drivers together** to understand:

- How long-term temperature increase influences disaster frequency and intensity  
- How climate cycles such as **ENSO (El Niño–La Niña)** are becoming more intense under warming conditions  
- How human activities amplify climate stress  
- How global changes translate into **local-level heat stress and human risk**

## 🧩 Datasets Used

Multiple datasets were collected and integrated to support both **global-level and region-based analysis**:

- **Natural Disaster Data (1900–2021)**  
  Historical records of climate-related disasters over time

- **Global Temperature Anomalies**  
  Long-term deviation from baseline global temperatures

- **Human Impact Master Dataset (Region-based)**  
  - CO₂ emissions  
  - CO₂ emissions per capita  
  - Methane emissions  
  - Forest cover / deforestation indicators  
  - Fossil fuel usage  

- **ENSO Cycle Dataset**  
  El Niño–La Niña intensity and variability over time

- **Urbanization Dataset**  
  Growth of urban population and land use

- **Heat Stress Dataset**  
  Combined analysis of:
  - Temperature  
  - Humidity  
  - Derived **Heat Index** to assess human risk levels  

All datasets were transformed and merged (human impact datasets into a single master climate fact table) to enable **regional comparison as well as global trend analysis**.

## 📊 Analytical Framework

The dashboard follows a structured analytical flow:

1. **Natural Disasters**  
   Over the past few decades, climate-related disasters have increased in frequency and intensity, closely aligning with rising global temperatures and the growing amplification of ENSO (El Niño–La Niña) cycles.

2. **Global Temperature Rise**  
   Establishing long-term warming trends

3. **Disasters Over Time**  
   Linking temperature rise with changes in disaster frequency and impact

4. **ENSO Intensification**  
   Showing how warming amplifies El Niño and La Niña cycles, contributing to floods and droughts

5. **Human Drivers of Climate Change**  
   Examining the role of emissions, deforestation, and fossil fuel usage

6. **Urbanization & Heat Islands**  
   Understanding how urban growth intensifies local heat exposure

7. **Heat Stress & Human Risk**  
   Demonstrating how temperature and humidity combine to create dangerous heat conditions at the local level
